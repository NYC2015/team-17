            &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Built over 40 years ago, Indian Point Nuclear Plant is located 25 miles
            north of New York City on the Hudson River at the intersection of two
            earthquake faults, the Ramapo Fault and the Stamford-to-Peekskill Fault
            Line. Indian Point is also sited in the most populous location of any
            US nuclear plant, with 20 million people living or working within 50 
            miles of the plant, and experts say that evacuation plans are severely 
            deficient. A catastrophic accident at Indian Point could kill tens of
            thousands, cause many more long-term cancers, and render NYC and much 
            of the Hudson Valley uninhabitable.<br />
            &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is considering Entergy’s 
            application to relicense Indian Point Reactors (IP) 2 & 3 which are 
            operating under their original 40 year licenses, expiring in 2013 and 2015, 
            respectively. Both IP2 and IP3 have been plagued with major safety problems 
            for decades. As the reactors age, Indian Point will experience an increasing 
            number of equipment and safety-related failures. <br />
            &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;As a recent explosion and shutdowns at Indian Point show, the plant’s aging 
            reactors pose an unnecessary and unacceptable risk to New York City residents. 
            In addition to its proximity to one of the largest metropolitan areas in the 
            United States and being located on two significant fault lines, Indian Point 
            has been rated the most vulnerable nuclear plant in the country to an 
            earthquake-induced meltdown. It is also known to be a potential target 
            for terrorism because of its proximity to NYC, presenting a tremendous 
            security risk. A 2011 Natural Resources Defense Council report found a major 
            accident at the plant could require the evacuation or sheltering of nearly 
            10 million people from radiation exposure (including most city residents) 
            and render much of NYC too radioactively contaminated to live in. A 2004 
            Union of Concerned Scientists study determined the economic costs of an 
            accident could be as high as $1.1 trillion, primarily because of the impact 
            on NYC.<br />
            &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;This is an unacceptable level of risk. New York City has a direct stake 
            in ensuring that Indian Point is not relicensed and closes when its federal
            operating licenses expire by the end of this year.
